						<p>
							While working on a cryptocurrency startup, Matt and his team faced challenges with
							Rust largely due to its ownership and borrowing system which adds a lot of complexity.
							We realized we needed a new programming language.
						</p>
						<p>
							This led to the birth of Flogram in March 2020. Our mission was to create a productive
							and high-performance programming language. As Flogram progressed, we realized that our
							features could benefit AI. From then on, AI code generation became our main endeavor.
						</p>
						<p>
							Flogram is not just a language; it's a gateway to pioneering AI innovations with ease.
							Join us in this exciting journey, and be part of a community that's reshaping the
							future of AI programming with Flogram.
